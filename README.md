# LeetCode Solutions in C++

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in C++. The goal is to practice, learn, and improve my problem-solving and coding skills, while keeping the code clean and well-organized.

## Structure

- Each problem solution is placed in its own `.cpp` file, grouped by topic or LeetCode section (e.g., `top_interview_150/`).
- Build system: [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used for easy compilation and project management.
- Some problems may have multiple approaches or optimizations, which are usually commented in the code.

## How to Build & Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leet_code_sol_cpp.git
   cd leet_code_sol_cpp
   ```

2. **Build with CMake:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Run a solution:**
   Executables are generated for each problem. For example:
   ```bash
   ./top_interview_150/merge_arr
   ```

## Why C++?

- C++ is widely used in competitive programming and technical interviews.
- It offers fine control over performance and memory.
- Practicing in C++ helps reinforce understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Notes

- Solutions are written with readability in mind, but sometimes optimized for performance.
- Comments are added to explain tricky parts or alternative approaches.
- If you spot a bug or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue or PR!

## License

This project is for educational purposes. Feel free to use the code as reference, but please do not submit it directly to LeetCode as your own.
